Put in mobile credentials in `first_data_jumpstart_sample_ios/SampleGmiViewController.m` and server credentials in `first_data_jumpstart_sample_ios/GmiServerAccess.m` and run the project in Xcode.

Note that `first_data_jumpstart_sample_ios/GmiServerAccess.m` is provided for ease of initial development and testing from within a single environment. Such code should never be shipped or used for production environments.
